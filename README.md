# JIRA-TicketManagement

This project tracks the task/issue that is created and also each task is assigned a priority by the user. Based on the priority it is possible to filter out the specific task. It is also possible to change the priority, edit and delete the task. **Local storage** is used to store the information about the ticket, so even if you refresh app data will be in the same state unless you clear the local storage.
